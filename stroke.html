                    A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing brain tissue to die. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is a major cause of adult disability.1,2 About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year.2 One American dies from a stroke every 4 minutes, on average.2 Get more quick facts about stroke. Stroke is a medical emergency. Know the signs and symptoms of stroke, and call 9-1-1 right away if you think someone might be having a stroke. Getting fast treatment is important to preventing death and disability from stroke. You may be able to prevent stroke or reduce your risk through healthy lifestyle changes. In addition, medication can reduce stroke risk for some people.

                    Stroke is a medical emergency. Know the signs and symptoms of stroke, and call 9-1-1 right away if you think someone might be having a stroke. Getting fast treatment is important to preventing death and disability from stroke. You may be able to prevent stroke or reduce your risk through healthy lifestyle changes. In addition, medication can reduce stroke risk for some people. To understand stroke, it helps to understand something about the brain. The brain controls our movements; stores our memories; and is the source of our thoughts, emotions, and language. The brain also controls many functions of the body, like breathing and digestion. To work properly, your brain needs oxygen. Although your brain makes up only 2% of your body weight, it uses 20% of the oxygen you breathe.1 Your arteries deliver oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your brain.
                </p>
                <h2>What Happens During a Stroke</h2>
                <p>
                    If something happens to interrupt the flow of blood, brain cells start to die within minutes because they can’t get oxygen. This is called a stroke. Sudden bleeding in the brain also can cause a stroke if it damages brain cells. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. If brain cells die or are damaged because of a stroke, symptoms of that damage start to show in the parts of the body controlled by those brain cells. Quick Treatment Is Critical for Stroke A stroke is a serious medical condition that requires emergency care. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or someone you are with shows any signs of a stroke. Learn more about the types of stroke, the signs and symptoms of a stroke, what treatments are available for stroke, and what happens after a stroke.

                <h2>Types of Stroke</h2>
                <p>
                    The main types of stroke are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ischemic stroke.</li>
                        <li>Hemorrhagic stroke.</li>
                        <li>Transient ischemic attack (a warning or “mini-stroke”).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Ischemic Stroke</h3>
                <p>
                    Most strokes (85%) are ischemic strokes.1 If you have an ischemic stroke, the artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. Read more about factors that increase risk for ischemic stroke.
                </p>

                <h3>Hemorrhagic Stroke</h3>
                <p>
                    A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open). The leaked blood puts too much pressure on brain cells, which damages them. High blood pressure and aneurysms—balloon-like bulges in an artery that can stretch and burst—are examples of conditions that can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. There are two types of hemorrhagic strokes: * Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It occurs when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood. * Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a less common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It refers to bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissues that cover it.
                </p>

                <h3>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)</h3>
                <p>
                    A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is sometimes called a "mini-stroke." It is different from the major types of stroke because blood flow to the brain is blocked for only a short time—usually no more than 5 minutes.2 It is important to know that
                    <ul>
                        <li>A TIA is a warning sign of a future stroke.</li>
                        <li>A TIA is a medical emergency, just like a major stroke.</li>
                        <li>Strokes and TIAs require emergency care. Call 9-1-1 right away if you feel signs of a stroke or see symptoms in someone around you.</li>
                        <li>There is no way to know in the beginning whether symptoms are from a TIA or from a major type of stroke.</li>
                        <li>Like ischemic strokes, blood clots often cause TIAs.</li>
                        <li>More than a third of people who have a TIA end up having a major stroke within 1 year if they don’t receive treatment, and 10%-15% will have a major stroke within 3 months of a TIA.</li>
                        <li>Recognizing and treating TIAs can reduce the risk of a major stroke. If you have a TIA, your health care team can find the cause and take steps to prevent a major stroke.</li>
                    </ul>
